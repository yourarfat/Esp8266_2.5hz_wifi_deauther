### Esp8266 2.5hz Wi-Fi Deauther With Display




## ðŸ§° Getting Started
We will use Nodumcu ESP8266 as a processor. and we will add an OLED display to show scanned values in graphs. we can scan and view the entire 2.4GHz network.

Requirements Components
- Esp8266 Board
- 0.96 oled Display
- Switch (3 pics)
- Breadboard for assembly (Optional)
- Jamping Wire (Optional)
- Power Source (Charger, Power Bank or mobile-otg)

## ðŸ”— Uploading the Firmware (.bin) to ESP8266

If you prefer not to upload the code manually or encounter errors during compilation, you can directly upload the precompiled `.bin` file to the ESP32. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Required Tools
1. **ESP8266 Flash Download Tool**: Download the tool from Espressif's official site: [ESP8266 Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/).
2.  **USB Drivers**: Make sure the drivers for the ESP8266 are installed on your system.

### Step 2: Prepare the `.bin` File
1. Download the [precompiled `.bin`](https://github.com/yourarfat/Esp8266_2.5hz_wifi_deauther/releases/download/2.6.1/esp8266_deauther_2.6.1_DSTIKE_DEAUTHER_OLED.bin) file from the repository. 

### Step 3: Upload the `.bin` File to ESP8266
1. Connect your ESP8266 to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the **ESP8266 Flash Download Tool** and configure the following:
   - Select the appropriate **chip type** (ESP8266) and click **OK**.
   - In the **Download Path Config** section, add the `.bin` file and set the start address to `0x10000`.
   - Select the correct **COM port** where your ESP8266 is connected.
   - Choose the correct **Baud rate** (115200 is generally recommended).

3. Click on **Start** to begin uploading the `.bin` file to your ESP8266.

### Step 4: Verify the Upload
Once the upload is completed, the tool will confirm a successful flash. You can now restart your ESP8266 and run the firmware.

### Arduino IDE 1.8 Settings:
If you want to upload the sketch code to the ESP8266, use the following settings in the Tools menu:
- **Built using ESP8266 Board Version 2.0.11**

# âœ¨ About this project
This firmware allows you to easily perform a variety of actions to test 802.11 networks using an <a href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266">Esp8266</a>. It's also a great project for learning about WiFi, microcontrollers, Arduino, hacking and electronics/programming in general.

The deauthentication attack is the main feature, which can be used to disconnect devices from their WiFi network.
Although this denial-of-service attack is nothing new, a lot of devices are still vulnerable to it. Luckily this is slowly changing with more WiFi 6 enabled devices being used. But a lot of outdated WiFi devices remain in place, for example in cheap IoT hardware. With an ESP8266 Deauther, you can easily test this attack on your 2.4GHz WiFi network/devices and see whether it's successful or not. And if it is, you know you should upgrade your network.
